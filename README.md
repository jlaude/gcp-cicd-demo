# GitOps CI/CD Pipeline with Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, and Skaffold

"Hello World" is a Kubernetes application that contains a single
[Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and a corresponding
[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). The Deployment contains a web server that renders a simple webpage.

The CI/CD pipeline uses GitOps to trigger a build when a change is pushed to the main branch. Cloud Build will be triggered to build the Hello World application OCI Image via Skaffold build then create a release for this build in Cloud Deploy. The release will automatically deploy the release to the staging GKE cluster.
